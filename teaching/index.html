	<h3>Teaching Experiences</h3>
	<br><br><br>
	<li> Trained as a sociologist, I approach teaching as a liberatory practice that cultivates self-awareness and critical reflection. One way I do this is by equipping students with theoretical insight and methodological tools that empower them to interpret their own lives and the world around them. I seek to create an inclusive and challenging environment that allows exploration under guidance. I believe that education should be inclusive, where meaningful learning arises from connection, trust, and relevance.  <li>
