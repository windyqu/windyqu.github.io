  <h2 class="section-title">Teaching Experiences</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    Trained as a sociologist, I approach teaching as a liberatory practice that cultivates
    self-awareness and critical reflection. One way I do this is by equipping students with
    theoretical insight and methodological tools that empower them to interpret their own lives
    and the world around them. I seek to create an inclusive and challenging environment that
    allows exploration under guidance. I believe that education should be inclusive, where
    meaningful learning arises from connection, trust, and relevance.
