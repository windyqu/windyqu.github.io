		I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://sociology.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Sociology at Cornell University</a>. My research focuses on social networks, health, aging, and the digital economy, focusing on the Chinese affective live-stream industry. I research the dynamic relationship between social networks and physical and mental health, particularly among older adults, and the health implications for their social networks. I also study how people engage in the growing live-streaming industry in China (e.g., virtual gifting) with respect to the broader social structure.
