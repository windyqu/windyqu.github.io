	<h1>Tianyao Qu</h3>
	<p>
		I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://sociology.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Sociology at Cornell University</a>. My research focuses on social networks, health, aging, and the digital economy, focusing on the Chinese affective live-stream industry. 
		My research areas are centered broadly in the areas of social networks, health, aging and the life course, economic sociology, and gender. Within these areas, my current work uses quantitative, social network analysis, sequence analysis, and mixed methods to understand the structural dynamics of both physical and digitalized social relationships and their consequences on health and well-being across the life course and over time. 
		My research has been funded by the Cornell Center of Economy & Society, Cornell Center for the Study of Inequality, and Cornell Center for Social Sciences Qualitative & Interpretive Research Institute.

	        My research focuses on examining how changes in, and the form and order of, social connections relate to health inequality over time and across the life course. I place particular emphasis on understanding the heterogeneous meanings brought by social contexts in which well-being is intertwined with social relationships. In my dissertation and other work, I develop the argument that social relationships and interactions are highly structured and regularized â€“ whether in the realms of virtual intimacy, personal networks, daily family interactions, or time spent with other people.
