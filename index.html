		Hi! I am Tianyao and I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://irsay.iu.edu/" target="_blank"> Irsay Research Institute at Indiana University Bloomington </a>. 
		I am a sociologist working in the areas of social networks, health and aging, intimacy and economy, time use, and gender. Within these areas, my work uses quantitative, social network analysis, sequence analysis, and mixed methods to understand the structural dynamics of both physical and digitalized social relationships and their consequences on health and well-being across the life course and over time. 
		My research has been funded by the Cornell Center of Economy & Society, Cornell Center for the Study of Inequality, and Cornell Center for Social Sciences Qualitative & Interpretive Research Institute.
