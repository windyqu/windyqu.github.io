		Hi! I am Tianyao, and I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://irsay.iu.edu/" target="_blank"> Irsay Research Institute at Indiana University Bloomington </a>. 
		I received my PhD in Sociology from Cornell University in 2024. I am a sociologist working in the areas of social networks, health and aging, intimacy and economy, time use, and gender. Within these areas, my work uses quantitative, social network analysis, sequence analysis, and mixed methods to understand the structural dynamics of both physical and digitalized social relationships and their consequences on health and well-being across the life course and over time. 
		My research has been funded by the Cornell Center for the Economy and Society, the Cornell Center for the Study of Inequality, and the Cornell Center for Social Sciences, Qualitative & Interpretive Research Institute.

		My work has appeared in Social Science & Medicine, Social Networks, and the Journal of Health and Social Behavior, among others.
