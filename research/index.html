  <h3>Research Experiences</h3>
  <br>
	<p>
       I am interested in using social networks as both a data source and an analytic framework to discern the social process that produces health consequences. 
	My research focuses on examining how changes in, and the form and order of, social connections relate to health inequality over time and across the life course. I place particular emphasis on understanding the heterogeneous meanings brought by social contexts in which well-being is intertwined with social relationships. In my dissertation and other work, I develop the argument that social relationships and interactions are highly structured and regularized – whether in the realms of virtual intimacy, personal networks, daily family interactions, or time spent with other people.

		<h4> (1) Social Networks and Health in Later Life </h4>

<br><br>
In the first chapter of my dissertation, I investigated how bridging across disparate social domains may influence mental health status among older adults. Using within- and between-person models, I find that bridging unconnected kin and non-kin members in the network could produce interpersonal strain that leads to elevated depressive symptoms over time, especially among older adults in the younger generations. This paper received the 2023 Cornell Sociology Department’s Robin M. Williams, Jr. Best Paper Award.

	</p>
	<p>
In this paper, I explored the direct and indirect roles of chronic health conditions in shaping structural features of interpersonal relationships that grant resources and independence in later life. Through lagged modeling approaches and mediation analysis, I constructed network turnover variables to show that older adults diagnosed with chronic illnesses moved to an endogenous network structure over time in which they have denser networks owing to stable family members, heightened interactions among family and friends and neighbors, as well as the shedding of non-kin ties.

	</p>
        <p>
In collaboration with Professor Cornwell, this paper investigates whether the spouse’s connections to other network members play a role in mitigating or exacerbating the widowhood effect in later life. Utilizing survival analysis and panel data with proxy mortality records, we revealed that mortality risks are higher among older individuals whose spouses were not well-connected to other members of their networks.

	        <h4> (2) Temporal-structure of Social Behaviors and Health Implications by Gender  </h4>
<p>
	My second line of research examines how the temporal organization of social life (daily activities and interactions)—whether structured or fragmented, stable or shifting—shapes momentary well-being and cumulative cognitive load.
</p>
	  <p>
One dissertation chapter using American Time Use Survey diaries demonstrates that individuals with structured weekday schedules (e.g., 9–5) reported better cognitive health and life satisfaction. This suggests that temporal embeddedness—alignment across widely shared social rhythms—confers health benefits, whereas time spent alone undermines health only among those lacking such regular routines.

Global Pandemic.” In preparation for submission.

	<p>	
As an extension, a first-authored postdoctoral project uses sequence data from ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of a state representative sample to show that older adults with more stable daily routines report lower cognitive effort in real time than those with more fragmented schedules. Moreover, older adults with poorer cognitive functioning (e.g., reduced working memory) are more likely to exhibit repetitive daily schedules across the week.

		<h4> (3) Relational Work in the Chinese Live-streaming Industry </h4>
  <p>
  Livestreaming shows have gained immense popularity in China in the past few years, attracting millions of viewers who financially support their favorite streamers through means like virtual gifts. This study explores what is valued and exchanged in the gifting process and how the relational match between live streamers and their patrons is produced through gifting. To delve into these dynamics, this study employs data from online observations at Douyin sibling TikTok, a leading video platform in China, along with 55 in-depth interviews with live streamers, patrons, and guild agents of both genders.
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  Building on Zelizer’s seminal concept of relational earmarking, I proposed an “earmark of emotions” framework conceptualizing (male) patron’s virtual gifting to live streamers as a way of acquiring virtual intimacy. Using mixed methods, I argue that patrons’ gender positions, intertwined with other socioeconomic factors, shape their emotional needs. These needs are monetized through gifting to live streamers, encompassing aspirations for elevated social status, masculinity ideals, identity recognition, companionship, and romantic fantasies. This project provides an economic lens to comprehend the growing use of communication technology in shaping gendered digitized intimacy due to the lack of connectedness amid the escalating complexity of relationship structures and mental health issues in East Asia.
