  <h3>Research Experiences</h3>

	<p>
               My research focuses on examining how changes in, and the form and order of, social connections relate to health inequality over time and across the life course. I place particular emphasis on understanding the heterogeneous meanings brought by social contexts in which well-being is intertwined with social relationships. In my dissertation and other work, I develop the argument that social relationships and interactions are highly structured and regularized – whether in the realms of virtual intimacy, personal networks, daily family interactions, or time spent with other people.
