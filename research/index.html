  <p>
    My research and teaching interests center on the sociology of health and illness, aging and the life course,
    social networks, gender, and economic sociology. Methodologically, my work combines demographic and statistical
    approaches with specialized tools such as social network analysis, multilevel and longitudinal modeling, and
    sequence analysis. Broadly, I aim to understand how social structures and micro-level processes shape health
    and well-being over time, with a particular emphasis on later life. Across projects, I investigate how social
    networks reflect and contribute to population-level health disparities, how the (in)stability and sequencing
    of daily routines regulate stress and cognitive well-being, and how environmental, temporal, and market
    contexts shape access to care and emotional resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    Specifically, I use social networks as both a data source and an analytic framework to identify social processes
    that produce health consequences. My work examines how changes in—along with the form and order of—social
    connections relate to health inequality over time and across the life course, with particular attention to the
    heterogeneous meanings that emerge from social contexts. In my dissertation and related projects, I argue that
    social relationships and interactions are highly structured and regularized, whether in the realms of virtual intimacy,
    personal networks, daily family interactions, or time spent with others.

      “A Bridge Too Far? Social Network Structure as a Determinant of Depression in Later Life.”
    </a>
    <i>Social Science &amp; Medicine</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first chapter of my dissertation, I investigate how bridging across disparate social domains influences mental health
    among older adults. Using within- and between-person models, I find that bridging unconnected kin and non-kin network members
    can produce interpersonal strain that elevates depressive symptoms over time, especially among younger cohorts of older adults.
    This paper received the 2023 Cornell Sociology Department’s Robin M. Williams, Jr. Best Paper Award.

  </p>
  <p>
    This paper examines direct and indirect roles of chronic conditions in shaping network structures that grant resources and independence
    in later life. Using lagged models and mediation analysis, I construct network turnover variables showing that older adults diagnosed with
    chronic illness move toward more endogenous network structures over time—denser networks driven by stable family members, heightened interactions
    among family/friends/neighbors, and the pruning of non-kin ties.

    </a>

  </p>
  <p>
    With Professor Cornwell, we test whether the spouse’s connections to other network members mitigate or exacerbate the widowhood effect.
    Leveraging survival analysis and panel data with proxy mortality records, we show that mortality risks are higher among older individuals
    whose spouses were weakly connected to others in their networks.

  <h3 class="sub-title">(2) Temporal Structure of Social Behaviors and Health Implications by Gender</h3>

  <p>
    My second line of research investigates how the temporal organization of social life—structured vs. fragmented, stable vs. shifting—shapes
    momentary well-being and cumulative cognitive load.
  </p>
  <p>
    One dissertation chapter using American Time Use Survey diaries shows that individuals with structured weekday schedules (e.g., 9–5) report
    better cognitive health and life satisfaction. Temporal embeddedness—alignment with widely shared social rhythms—confers health benefits,
    whereas time spent alone undermines health primarily among those lacking regular routines.

  </p>

  <p>
    Extending this work, a first-authored postdoctoral project uses sequence data from ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in a state-representative
    sample to show that older adults with more stable daily routines report lower cognitive effort in real time than those with fragmented schedules.
    Moreover, older adults with poorer cognitive functioning (e.g., reduced working memory) are more likely to exhibit repetitive daily schedules across the week.

  <h3 class="sub-title">(3) Relational Work in the Chinese Live-Streaming Industry</h3>

  <p>
    Livestreaming has surged in China, with viewers financially supporting streamers through virtual gifts. This project examines what is valued and exchanged
    in gifting and how relational matching between streamers and patrons is produced. Data come from online observations on Douyin (TikTok’s sibling) and
    55 in-depth interviews with streamers, patrons, and guild agents of all genders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building on Zelizer’s concept of relational earmarking, I propose an “earmark of emotions” framework: (male) patrons’ virtual gifting as acquisition of
    virtual intimacy. Using mixed methods, I show how gender positions and socioeconomic factors shape emotional needs that are monetized through gifting—
    aspirations for status elevation, masculinity ideals, identity recognition, companionship, and romantic fantasy. This work provides an economic lens on
    gendered, digitized intimacy amid weakening connectedness and rising mental-health concerns in East Asia.
