  <h3>Research Experiences</h3>
  <br><be>
	<p>
               My research focuses on examining how changes in, and the form and order of, social connections relate to health inequality over time and across the life course. I place particular emphasis on understanding the heterogeneous meanings brought by social contexts in which well-being is intertwined with social relationships. In my dissertation and other work, I develop the argument that social relationships and interactions are highly structured and regularized – whether in the realms of virtual intimacy, personal networks, daily family interactions, or time spent with other people.

A Bridge Too Far? Social Network Structure as a Determinant of Depression in Later Life (Manuscript Upon Request) 
<br><br>
In the first chapter of my dissertation, I investigated how bridging across disparate social domains may influence mental health status among older adults. Using within- and between-person models, I find that bridging unconnected kin and non-kin members in the network could produce interpersonal strain that leads to elevated depressive symptoms over time, especially among older adults in the younger generations. This paper received the 2023 Cornell Sociology Department’s Robin M. Williams, Jr. Best Paper Award.

Chronic Illness and Social Network Bridging in Later Life
In this paper published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.01.007" target="_blank">“Social Networks”</a> in 2023, 
	I explored the direct and indirect roles of chronic health conditions in shaping structural features of interpersonal relationships that grant resources and independence in later life. Through lagged modeling approaches and mediation analysis, I constructed network turnover variables to show that older adults diagnosed with chronic illnesses moved to an endogenous network structure over time in which they have denser networks owing to stable family members, heightened interactions among family and friends and neighbors, as well as the shedding of non-kin ties.
